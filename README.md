Command-line cross-compiler of assembly language for [Z80 CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80).

Supports many [ZX-Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) specific directives, has built-in Lua scripting engine and 3-pass design.

For Linux, BSD and [Windows (click for exe)](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus/releases/latest). Make/Make Install or CMake [installation methods](INSTALL.md) for your convenience.

Online [documentation](http://z00m128.github.io/sjasmplus/documentation.html) (it is also included in the binary-release zip for offline viewing).

Post issues, feedback, feature requests, etc on [github](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus/issues).

Main Features
=============

* Full source of assembler available under BSD license, modify and extend as you wish
* Z80/R800/Z80N documented and undocumented opcodes support
* Macro language, defines, array of defines
* Built-in Lua scripting engine
* Conditional assembly, block repeating
* Modules (namespaces), local and temporary labels
* Source and binary file inclusion, include paths
* Multi file output, file updating, various types of exports
* Structures to work easily with structured data in memory (`STRUCT` pseudo-op)
* Virtual device mode for common machines: ZX 128, ZX Next, … (pseudo op `DEVICE`)
* ZX Spectrum specific directives and pseudo ops (SAVESNA, SAVETAP, SAVEHOB, INCHOB, INCTRD…)
* ZX Spectrum Next specific features and directives (Z80N, 8ki memory paging, `SAVENEX`)
* Correctness is assured by Cirrus-CI with 240+ automated tests (that's also 240+ examples of usage!)
* Fake instructions as `LD HL,DE` (`LD H,D:LD L,E`) and more
* Code inlining through colon (`LD A,C:INC A:PUSH AF:IFDEF FX:LD A,D:ENDIF`…)
* Very fast compilation: 1 million lines by 2-3 seconds on modern computer
* Multiline block comments and user’s messages
