Command-line cross-compiler of assembly language for Z80 CPU. 

Supports many ZX-Spectrum specific directives, has built-in Lua scripting engine and 3-pass design.

For Linux/BSD/Windows/Dos. Make/Make Install or CMake installation methods for your convenience.

Main Features
=============

- Z80/R800/Z80N documented and undocumented opcodes support
- Very fast compilation: 1 million lines by 2-3 seconds on modern computer
- Code inlining through colon (`LD A,C:INC A:PUSH AF:IFDEF FX:LD A,D:ENDIF`â€¦)
- Structures to define data structures in memory more easily (`STRUCT` pseudo-op)
- Conditional assembly
- Macro definitions
- Local labels
- User's messages
- Temporary labels
- Virtual device mode for common machines: ZX 128, ZX Next, ... (pseudo op `DEVICE`)
- Defines and array of defines
- Fake instructions as `LD HL,DE` (`LD H,D:LD L,E`) and more
- Source and binary file inclusion
- Multiline block comments
- Multi file output and file updating
- ZX Spectrum specific directives and pseudo ops (SAVESNA, SAVETAP, SAVEHOB, INCHOB, INCTRD...)
- ZX Spectrum Next specific features and directives (Z80N, 8ki memory paging, SAVENEX)
- Correctness is assured by Cirrus-CI with 140+ automated tests
