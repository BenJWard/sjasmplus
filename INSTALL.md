## Installation Instructions
Requirements:
- Linux / Unix / MacOS / BSD with bash compatible shell 
- all common system progs (grep, cat, etc...)
- all common build requirements (libc, libstdc++, g++, make, etc...)
- optionally CMake

or

- complete MinGW environment for MS Windows, with MinGW bin directories added in PATH variable (typically C:\MinGW\bin; C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin)
- CMake installed into MinGW bin directory (optionally)

Compilation is tested with GCC 5.5.0, it should run also with older 5.x versions. It will not work with GCC 4.x and older.

## Default method for Linux / Unix / MacOS / BSD
Extract tarball archive and go to extracted folder. Edit install path `PREFIX` in file `Makefile` according your preferences (default /usr/local). Run following commands:
```
	make clean
	make
```
Then run as root or use sudo:
```
	make install
```

## Default method for MS Windows
Extract tarball archive and go to extracted folder. Edit install path `PREFIX` in file `Makefile.win` according your preferences (default c:\mingw\usr\local\bin). Remove `-static` parameter in `CFLAGS` if you don't need standalone Windows executable (binary is MinGW dependant then, but it's smaller). Run following commands:

	make -f Makefile.win clean
	make -f Makefile.win
	make -f Makefile.win install

## CMAKE method for Linux / Unix / MacOS / BSD
Extract tarball archive, go to extracted folder and run following set of commands:

	mkdir build 
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
	make
	make install

You can have external Lua and ToLua, it is detected automatically. If not, internal version is used.

For disabling of LUA scripting support add following option:
```
	-DENABLE_LUA=OFF 
```
E.g:
```
cmake -DENABLE_LUA=OFF ..
```

Binary sjasmplus file will be placed in /usr/bin by default.

To change install directory prefix add following option with specified prefix:

	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local

	e.g: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local ..


## CMake method for MS Windows
Extract tarball archive and go to the extracted folder. Delete or rename file `Makefile`. Rename file `Makefile.win` to `Makefile`. Create `build` subdirectory and enter to it. Run following command:

	cmake-gui
	
Click `Browse Source...` button, select extracted tarball folder. Click `Browse Build...` button, select the `build` folder. Click `Configure` button, select `MinGW Makefiles`, select `Use default native compilers`. Click `Finish` and wait until configuration is done. Change `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` install path according your peferences (click on path). Click `Generate`. Run `cmd.exe`, enter the build directory and run following commands:

	make
	make install	

Enjoy!
